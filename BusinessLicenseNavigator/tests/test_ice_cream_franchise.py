Test for Ice Cream Franchise Acceptance Criteria.

This test verifies that:
1. Query "I want to open an ice cream franchise in FL for Rita's" 
2. Uses Fetch and Playwright to create augmented prompt
3. Augmented prompt is fed into the LLM
4. Results show source information along with license information
